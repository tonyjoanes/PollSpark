# PollSpark

PollPulse is a fast, engaging web app for creating and voting in short polls, built to showcase modern C# and React skills. It features a clean, functional programming-inspired backend with Minimal APIs, MediatR, and union types, paired with a responsive React frontend. Key features include JWT authentication, poll creation, voting, real-time results, and data export for monetization.

## Features
- **Create Polls**: Authenticated users can create polls with 2â€“4 options.
- **Vote**: Public or authenticated voting with one-click simplicity.
- **View Results**: Real-time results with percentage breakdowns, visualized in React with Recharts.
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT-based login/register using ASP.NET Core Identity.
- **Data Export**: Anonymized poll data for admins, enabling monetization for marketers.
- **Functional Programming**: Uses `OneOf` for union types, immutable `record` types, and pure MediatR handlers.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: C# (.NET 8), ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs, MediatR, Entity Framework Core, SQLite (dev)/PostgreSQL (prod), `OneOf` for union types.
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, React Router, React Hook Form, Recharts, Axios.
- **Tools**: Swagger for API documentation, GitHub for version control.

## Architecture
PollPulse follows a clean, modular architecture inspired by CQRS and functional programming:
- **Inputs**: Type-safe commands (`CreatePollCommand`) and validated user inputs.
- **Processing**: MediatR handlers for business logic, Minimal APIs for routing, EF Core for data access.
- **Outputs**: JSON responses (`PollDto`, `PollResultsDto`) and React-rendered UI.
